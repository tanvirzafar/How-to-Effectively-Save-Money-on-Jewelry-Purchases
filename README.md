## How to Effectively Save Money on Jewelry Purchases
Jewelry is an important aspect of our daily fashion (and also a means of showing class and prestige). However, there are many ways through which people look to dupe buyers, especially since everyone knows that jewelry costs quite a lot. If you’re looking to save money and still get good jewelry, these tips will help you out.

## Avoid the usual chain stores

You might not be aware of it but most jewelry stores that you see as malls or the usual gallerias that align many corners in the city and which offer a wide array of jewelry have a high chance of having enormous markups. The markup that is usually put on jewelry in most of the chain stores that you see around can be as much as 700% or 800%.
As opposed to the usual chain stores, you might want to consider a smaller and more independent jeweler. This is because most of them sell jewelry of much higher quality and they do their best to bat down prices than in the chain stores.
Also, make sure to look around. There are many jewelry stores in various cities so ensure that you compare your prices effectively. 

## Look for online retailers

It is also very possible that you will find high-quality and cost effective jewelry on the internet. Online jewelers can offer much lower prices, especially due to the fact that they have no need to pay for salespeople, establishments or premises, and other overhead costs. Also, you can even get a better price is the seller isn’t adding a huge markup.
However, you should also be careful when buying jewelry online. The chances of you getting fakes are very high and you can lose quite a lot of money. To guard against this, make sure to only with a [reputable online jewelry retailer](https://www.midwestjewellery.com/) with generous return policies.

## Certify the gem as well

You should also ensure that the jewelry that you purchase is properly certified. The American Gem Society and the Gemological Institute of America are bodies that are in charge of certifications so you should seek their approval, especially if you are spending a lot. Take your jewelry to an independent appraiser who has the right qualifications. That way, you can rest assured of what you’re buying.

## Invest more in silver jewelry

Gold costs about $1,500 an ounce. This price means that many buyers have begun to seek silver-based jewelry. Although those who like gold might see it as “settling for less,” you might not have a choice if you’re looking to save money. However, if you must have gold, feel free to get silver jewelry with gold accents. That way, you can get gold and still keep costs minimal. 
One thing to note about silver is that you must take care of it really well so it doesn’t get damaged. 

## There are awesome alternatives to diamonds.

A lot of people are fans of diamonds. However, the truth is that they’re quite expensive. There are a lot of alternatives that you can choose from that won’t cost as much as diamonds. If you don’t feel the compulsion to get diamonds, then you have the ability to save quite a lot of money on jewelry by purchasing pieces that have been fit with other stones.

## Considered used jewelry?

Another thing that you need to understand is the fact that you don’t necessarily have to buy something new. As a matter of fact, you can easily get sweet deals at pawn shops, and by using the Classifieds. Another awesome way to get good-price jewelry is through online auctions and estate sales. Here, you can get quality used jewelry and still save a lot.
However, like every other form of purchasing jewelry, you need to be careful here as well, especially as you need to ascertain that what you are getting is something that is genuine. If you have the chance, make sure to ask for certifications.

## Don’t just look at size.

If you’re looking to save the most on your jewelry, this point is one that you should always keep in mind. You should know that a truly valuable gemstone has more to it than just the size or how bug you see it as. Factors such as clarity and cut also matter a great deal. Sometimes, there might b flaws behind the big size that you see. You might also be paying higher because some jewelers will want to make you look more at its size and less at other important factors. However, a smaller stone with fewer flaws might be more valuable than a large stone with many flaws. If you’re not aware of that, you might end up paying more due to its intimidating size.
